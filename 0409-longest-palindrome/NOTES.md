Solved by using LINQ (Language Integrated Query).
1. s.GroupBy(c => c).Select(g => g.Count()): Groups the characters in the string s by each character, and then selects the count of each group.
2. charCount.Sum(count => count / 2 * 2): For each character count, count / 2 * 2 calculates the largest even part. Summing these values gives the total length contributed by characters with even counts.
3. charCount.Any(count => count % 2 == 1): This line checks if there is at least one character with an odd count. Any is a LINQ method that determines if any elements in a sequence satisfy a specified condition. It returns true if at least one element meets the condition; otherwise, it returns false.
4. If isOdd is true, add 1 to the length to account for a center character in the palindrome.
